# Progress

Live task state. Updated at the end of every task. A fresh session reads this to resume.

**Phase 1 — data and evaluation infrastructure. No generative model yet.**

## Next action

> **Phase 1 is complete (13/13). Phase 2 has begun and the model generates.**
>
> On 2026-08-31 the project produced handwriting for the first time: held-out CVL
> writer 0057, one real line as style, three lines that writer never wrote, in a
> visibly matching hand. See `docs/phase2-first-generation.md` and
> `outputs/probe_lines/lines_contrast.png`.
>
> ### The immediate next task
>
> **Build a line-level pack, then run `scripts/evaluate_generator.py` on Colab.**
> That produces the project's first real numbers against the phase-1 references.
>
> Two reasons it must be lines rather than the existing word pack:
> - `normalise_word` stretches every crop to a fixed 64px, so a one-letter word
>   becomes as tall as a line. Relative scale is destroyed, and word-level
>   generation produced tiny faint marks and runaway outputs.
> - Emuru generates lines natively. CVL ships 13,785 line images; their text is
>   reassembled from the word filenames (see `_cvl_lines` in
>   `scripts/check_metrics.py`).
>
> Apply `normalise_ink` when loading lines. Raw CVL lines are low-contrast, the
> model faithfully reproduces what it is given, and that is the whole cause of the
> faint output.
>
> **Run evaluation on Colab, not locally.** 220s per line on CPU; minutes on a T4.
>
> ### Known and open
>
> - Emuru needs the style sample's *transcription*. A user photographing a page
>   has transcribed nothing, so the product must read it first -- TrOCR is already
>   here for that, at TrOCR's accuracy. This constrains the architecture.
> - Two of five word-level requests ran to the token limit instead of stopping.
>   The known Emuru failure; its successor Eruku exists to fix it. Watch at line
>   level.
> - `data/processed/cvl_words_64.lmdb` shows 8 GB but holds 469 MB; it is sparse
>   and locked by a stale handle. The compacted copy for uploading is at
>   `data/processed/upload/cvl_words_64.lmdb`. A reboot clears the lock.
> - transformers is pinned to 4.x. 5.x cannot load Emuru and breaks TrOCR's
>   tokenizer -- the same version gap causes both.

## Waiting on Amri

- [ ] IAM download into `data/raw/iam/`. **The FKI site is currently down** -- links do not
      load from either side. Not blocking: `tests/test_iam_real.py` activates by itself the
      moment `data/raw/iam/xml/*.xml` exists, and validates the reconstructed schema then.
      Priority order once reachable: `xml.tgz` (small, answers the schema question),
      then `ascii.tgz`, then `words.tgz` (~1.2GB).
- [x] 5 phone photos received. **They are on squared/graph paper** -- grid lines will be
      read as ink by naive binarisation. Ruled-line removal is now part of T6's scope.
- [x] `cvl-database-1-1.zip` downloaded and extracted. 99,904 cropped word images with
      transcriptions in their filenames; 98,179 usable after filtering.
- [ ] Weights & Biases username (the identifier only — never the API key)
- [x] Commit permission granted (messages record what was done and what changed)

## Open questions

- **Python version.** Local is 3.13.2 with torch 2.13.0+cpu (the CPU-only wheel, 122 MB).
  Colab's Python and torch versions are unknown; run `!python --version` and
  `import torch; torch.__version__` in the first Colab session and pin to match.
- **Architecture decided (2026-08-29): option C.** Start from a released zero-shot
  checkpoint (Emuru line) rather than training a generator from scratch. Amri approved.
  Consequences: no per-writer training; the generator produces variable-length lines, so
  word-to-line assembly leaves the layout engine's scope; IAM becomes evaluation data, not
  training data; generation resolution is 64px, upscaled afterwards. VATr++ stays as a
  documented fallback and comparison baseline. Surveys and their unverified-claims lists are
  in `docs/`.
- **IAM licence is non-commercial research use.** Fine for a portfolio project; a blocker if
  this ever ships as a product. Flagged early on purpose.

## Log

- **2026-08-28 — T0 done.** Package `nib-synth` installs editable as `nib`. Deviated from the
  brief's proposed layout: `src/nib/...` instead of `src/...`, so imports work from any working
  directory. torch deliberately excluded from base dependencies. Added `.gitattributes` for
  LF/CRLF, which would otherwise show every file as modified between Windows and Colab.
  Not committed — awaiting Amri.
