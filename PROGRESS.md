# Progress

Live task state. Updated at the end of every task. A fresh session reads this to resume.

**Phase 1 — data and evaluation infrastructure. No generative model yet.**

## Next action

> **T10 — the three metrics.** The longest remaining task. Amri has approved the
> model downloads it needs: TrOCR (~1.4 GB, needs `transformers`) for the CER
> baseline, and Inception (~100 MB) for FID.
>
> Amri has given standing approval to work through to T12 without checking in,
> stopping only for things that genuinely need him.

| T12 | Colab end-to-end smoke run | not started | **phase 1 exit criterion**, Amri runs |

## Waiting on Amri

- [ ] IAM download into `data/raw/iam/`. **The FKI site is currently down** -- links do not
      load from either side. Not blocking: `tests/test_iam_real.py` activates by itself the
      moment `data/raw/iam/xml/*.xml` exists, and validates the reconstructed schema then.
      Priority order once reachable: `xml.tgz` (small, answers the schema question),
      then `ascii.tgz`, then `words.tgz` (~1.2GB).
- [x] 5 phone photos received. **They are on squared/graph paper** -- grid lines will be
      read as ink by naive binarisation. Ruled-line removal is now part of T6's scope.
- [x] `cvl-database-1-1.zip` downloaded and extracted. 99,904 cropped word images with
      transcriptions in their filenames; 98,179 usable after filtering.
- [ ] Weights & Biases username (the identifier only — never the API key)
- [x] Commit permission granted (messages record what was done and what changed)

## Open questions

- **Python version.** Local is 3.13.2 with torch 2.13.0+cpu (the CPU-only wheel, 122 MB).
  Colab's Python and torch versions are unknown; run `!python --version` and
  `import torch; torch.__version__` in the first Colab session and pin to match.
- **Architecture decided (2026-08-29): option C.** Start from a released zero-shot
  checkpoint (Emuru line) rather than training a generator from scratch. Amri approved.
  Consequences: no per-writer training; the generator produces variable-length lines, so
  word-to-line assembly leaves the layout engine's scope; IAM becomes evaluation data, not
  training data; generation resolution is 64px, upscaled afterwards. VATr++ stays as a
  documented fallback and comparison baseline. Surveys and their unverified-claims lists are
  in `docs/`.
- **IAM licence is non-commercial research use.** Fine for a portfolio project; a blocker if
  this ever ships as a product. Flagged early on purpose.

## Log

- **2026-08-28 — T0 done.** Package `nib-synth` installs editable as `nib`. Deviated from the
  brief's proposed layout: `src/nib/...` instead of `src/...`, so imports work from any working
  directory. torch deliberately excluded from base dependencies. Added `.gitattributes` for
  LF/CRLF, which would otherwise show every file as modified between Windows and Colab.
  Not committed — awaiting Amri.
